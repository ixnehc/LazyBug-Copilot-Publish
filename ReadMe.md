## Core Features

**1. Intelligent Chat System**

- Supports Markdown-based multi-turn chat display with rich media presentations including code highlighting and Diff views, with adjustable font sizes.
- Switch between historical sessions with ease.
- One-click rollback to any historical session state, with the ability to cancel the rollback.
- Displays session cost statistics.
- Chat history is stored per VS solution and persisted to disk.

**2. Smart Code Editing**

- AI can directly modify file contents within the project, supporting simultaneous edits across multiple files.
- View before-and-after comparisons (Diff View) in the code editor window.
- File modification tracking and rollback support.
- A file backup system ensures original files can be recovered in case of rollback failures (e.g., due to system bugs).

**3. Codebase Search**

- Builds a fast search index based on solution file symbols and text content.
- Supports fast text search for ultra-large projects.
- Supports fast symbol queries for ultra-large projects (C/C++/C# currently supported).
- AI automatically reads related file contents to acquire the necessary context.

**4. Smart Input Box**

![chatinput2.jpg](chatinput2.jpg)

- Uses a tag system to manage attached files.
- Auto-completion: trigger file/symbol auto-completion using the `@` symbol.
- Browse input history quickly using `PageUp`/`PageDown`.
- Quickly switch between Large Language Models.
- Paste an image directly into the input window and send it to the LLM.

**6. Custom Prompts**

- Skill system supported, with a panel to browse, create, rename, and toggle skills.

![skill.jpg](skill.jpg)

- `global_rules.txt` and `project_rules.txt` for writing global and project-specific prompts.
- `cli_whitelist.ini` for adding trusted CLI commands.

**7. CLI Tool**

- CLI tool supported, with skills to extend capabilities beyond coding.

**8. Context Usage Control**

- Displays real-time context usage.
- Set different context levels (5 levels total) to control the context size range.

![contextlevel.jpg](contextlevel.jpg)

- If context usage exceeds the current level's upper bound, context compression is triggered automatically.
- Context decompression is triggered when a higher context level is set.


## Usage Scenarios

- **Code Review and Refactoring**: Let AI analyze your code and suggest refactoring improvements.
- **New Feature Development**: Describe your requirements, and AI will assist in generating code frameworks and implementations.
- **Bug Fixing**: Describe the issue symptoms, and AI will help locate and fix the bug.
- **Code Explanation**: Ask about complex code logic, and AI will provide detailed explanations.

---

## Usage Tips

- **Open the Chat Panel**: Open the chat panel via the Visual Studio menu `View` → `Other Windows` → `LazyBug Chat`. It is recommended to bind a shortcut to the `View.LazyBugChat` command for quick access.
- **Database and Disk Space**: The LazyBug chat database is independent of the project and is stored centrally on the C drive. Please ensure sufficient free space on your C drive (for ultra-large projects, more than 10 GB may be required).
- **Adding File Attachments**:
  - Select a file in the **Solution Explorer**, right-click, and choose **Add to LazyBug Chat** to attach it to the current conversation.
  - You can also do the same by right-clicking the file's tab above the code editor.
- **Automatic Search and Context**: Attachments in the chat window are fully submitted to the LLM. However, in most cases you do not need to manually attach files — just provide relevant keywords and AI will automatically search for and read the necessary file contents.
- **Symbol Database Construction (C/C++)**: When you open a C/C++ project for the first time, LazyBug will automatically build the symbol database in the background. For ultra-large projects (e.g., 3 million lines of code), this process may take a significant amount of time (approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour). Symbol query results may not be fully accurate until the build is complete.
- **Code Comparison (Diff View)**:
  - Click the title of a file editing block in the chat panel to display the Diff view in the main editor; press `Space` to hide it.
  - Clicking the title repeatedly allows you to quickly jump between different diff hunks.
- **Avoid Editing Conflicts**: Please do not manually edit files while AI is working, especially when it is modifying file contents.
- **UI Scaling**: When the mouse focus is inside the LazyBug chat window, hold `Ctrl` and scroll the mouse wheel to freely zoom the interface and text size.
- **Custom API and Prompt Cache**: When configuring custom LLM APIs, if the provider supports it, prefer using the native API format (especially for Anthropic models) to ensure the Prompt Cache feature works correctly.
- **Cost Statistics**: The cost for each chat turn is calculated based on the unit price entered in the configuration file. When the LLM provider uses a complex billing model (such as a subscription plan), the statistics are approximate and for reference only.
- **Context Progress Bar and Limits**:
  - **Progress Bar**: Reflects the context usage of the most recent chat turn. When the bar turns red, the context is nearly exhausted and LLM output quality may degrade (e.g., hallucinations may occur).
  - **Upper Limit**: The upper limit of the progress bar can be set in the LLM API configuration file, representing the maximum context length at which the model maintains high-quality output (typically set slightly below the model's nominal maximum capacity).
  - **Recommendation**: When the progress bar turns red, avoid continuing the conversation in the current session and consider starting a new one.
- **Task Breakdown Strategy**: LazyBug is not designed to handle extremely large and complex tasks in a single pass. Break your development tasks into smaller, clearly defined sub-tasks for the best AI-assisted experience.
- **Code Database Updating**: After adding a new file to the solution, save the solution file so that the new file is included in the code database.
- **Skill Usage**:
  - There are 3 types of skills:
    - **BuiltIn**: Verified skills bundled with the extension. These should generally not be modified.
    - **Global**: Skills shared across all projects.
    - **Project**: Skills specific to the currently opened project.
  - Install the necessary environments (Node.js, Python, etc.) to support various CLI commands.
  - Activating a skill does not mean its full content is loaded into the context. To force-load a skill, copy its path and paste it into the file attachment list.
  - Many existing skills exist in the ecosystem and may have compatibility issues with LazyBug. You may need to tweak them until they work smoothly.
  - You are always encouraged to use AI to edit existing skills or create new ones.
